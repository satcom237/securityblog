    <h2 id="blog-heading_page">Basics of Malware</h2>
    <h3 id="blog-heading-date_page">30 June 2019</h3>
      <p>This week I learned the basics of malware. Malware is the short term for “Malicious Software”. This term encompasses viruses, trojans, worms, and other harmful programs that are used by hackers cause damage and/or gain access to sensitive information.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Virus – This is a piece of code that injects itself into a standalone program, where it maliciously spread itself</li>
        <li>Trojan – Reflecting the Trojan Horse story, this is a piece of code that disguises itself as something a user may want; and when activated can cause damage to their computer</li>
        <li>Worm – Similar to viruses, worms can reproduce themselves and spread from computer to computer. Unlike viruses however, they do not need a host program or human to propagate</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Throughout the lecture, I gathered some more key terminology relating to malware:
        <ul>
          <li>Ransomware – This is also a subset of malware in which data becomes maliciously locked, usually by an encryption method and the hacker demands money for decrypting the data back to the user. This kind of malware can be spread through mediums such as software applications, infected websites, and even simple email attachments</li>
          <li>Spyware – This is a type of malware that secretly gathers a user’s data without them knowing. An example of this is a keylogger, which hackers use to record all the keystrokes a user makes. This method is great for stealing password</li>
          <li>Adware – This malware forces user’s browsers to redirect to other websites where free malicious apps/games are prompted for the user to download. These kinds of websites can also collect marketing data about the user</li>
        </ul></p>

      <p>Next, we focus on why someone would want to create such harmful code and spread it – what is their motives? The biggest motivation is money. Ransomware is a good example where money is the primary target. Other motivations include research, political, and personal enjoyment.</p>

      <p>We then dived into the detection of malware and the tools that would help identify them. Some tools we went over included flypaper, fakenet, and process monitor. As well as detection, getting rid of malware was briefly discussed. Though removing malware can be very tricky, there are many solutions out there varying in price that help remove cryptojacking, rootkits, and ransomware for example. We also learned about modifying the Windows registry to identify any changes made by the malware.</p>

      <p>One interesting concept I took from the lectures was polymorphic viruses. A polymorphic virus is a harmful type of malware that can change itself, making it very difficult to be caught by antimalware software. Even though the appearance of the code may be different over each mutation, it’s intended function usually remains the same. This can become a problem for antimalware software where the first iteration of this virus could be caught; though the second may fail to be detected since its signature wasn’t added to the database. On the contrary, newer security technologies are rolling out with enhanced features such as machine learning where antimalware depend moreover on behavioral analytics instead of signature detection.</p>
